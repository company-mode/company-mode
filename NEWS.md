## 2017-03-29 (0.9.3)

* New variable `company-echo-truncate-lines`.
* `company-auto-complete` improved compatibility with `electric-pair-mode`.
* Use of `overriding-terminal-local-map` does not disable completion.
* `company-clang` and `company-gtags` can work over Tramp.
* New frontend `company-preview-common-frontend`.
* `company-clang` calls Clang using a pipe instead of pty.
* The minimum required version of Emacs is now 24.3.

## 2016-11-14 (0.9.2)

* Miscellaneous fixes and docstring improvements.

## 2016-11-12 (0.9.1)

* `company-indent-or-complete-common` skips trying to indent if
  `indent-line-function` is `indent-relative` or `indent-relative-maybe`.
* Better visualization of search matches. New face `company-tooltip-search-selection`.
* New variable `company-files-exclusions`.
* `company-next-page` and `company-previous-page` adhere to
  `company-selection-wrap-around` docstring more closely and only wrap around
  when the selection is at the start of the end of the list.
* `company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend-with-delay` handles custom
  frontends derived from `company-preview-frontend` better.
* `company-idle-delay` is automatically adjusted to a non-zero value.

## 2016-06-23 (0.9.0)

* Group of backends can now contain keyword `:separate`, which makes candidates
  from different backends sorted separately in the combined list.
* New frontend `company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend-with-delay`.
* New transformer `company-sort-prefer-same-case-prefix`.
* The value of `company-dabbrev-ignore-buffers` can also be a function.
* `company-files` has been moved to right after `company-capf` in
  `company-backends`
  ([#463](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/463)).
* `company-semantic-insert-arguments`: New option. Like in `company-clang`.
* `company-semantic-begin-after-member-access`: New option. Similar to the one
  in `company-clang`.
* `company-capf` accepts `:company-prefix-length` property value.

  the selected tooltip line.
* `company-clang-objc-templatify` has been renamed to
  `company-template-objc-templatify`.
* New user option `company-etags-everywhere`.
* `company-yasnippet` supports `yas-key-syntaxes` better. But we use them in the
  reverse order, preferring the longest key prefix that matches anything. And we
  only consider trigger key prefixes that are at least as long as the symbol at
  point, which effectively means skipping the `"w"` element
  ([#422](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/422)).
* New user option `company-search-regexp-function`.
* Completion is not started automatically when a keyboard macro is being
  recorded ([#374](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/374)).

* `company-template-c-like-templatify` does not replace the default argument
  values with `argN` anymore
  ([#336](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/336)). This
  affects `company-clang` and all third-party backends that use this function.
* Likewise for `company-clang-objc-templatify`.
* `company-template-add-field` calling convention has changed.
* New user option `company-dabbrev-ignore-invisible`.
* `company-ropemacs` was removed. `ropemacs` supports completion via
  `completion-at-point-functions` starting with version 0.8.
* `company-pysmell` was removed.
* `company-select-next`, `company-select-previous`,
  `company-select-next-or-abort`, `company-select-previous-or-abort` and
  `company-complete-common-or-cycle` accept a numeric argument.

  the search string.
* `company-semantic` displays function arguments as annotations.
* New user option, `company-bbdb-modes`.
* `company-show-numbers` and `company-complete-number` now use visual numbering
  of the candidates, taking into account only the ones currently displayed.

  without modifiers.
* `company-cmake` expands `<LANG>` and `<CONFIG>` placeholders inside variable
  names.

## 2014-10-15 (0.8.6)

* `company-clang` and `company-template-c-like-templatify` support templated
  functions and arguments.
* `company-dabbrev` ignores "uninteresting" buffers by default. Depends on the
  new user option, `company-dabbrev-ignore-buffers`.

* Two `company-elisp` tweaks.

## 2013-04-01 (0.6.6)

* `company-elisp` doesn't offer completions when typing the name and the
  arguments of a new function or macro definition, allowing to fall back to
  other back-ends like `company-dabbrev-code`.

## 2013-03-30 (0.6.5)

* Fixed keybindings when running in a terminal.
* `company-elisp-show-locals-first`: new customizable variable.

  input the last argument in a method call expanded by `company-eclim`, you can

  action (such as `company-complete-{selection,number,mouse}`).

  fields, it's displayed at the beginning, not right after it; `<tab>` jumps to
  the next field, `forward-word` and `subword-forward` remappings are removed;
  when you jump to the next field, if the current one hasn't been edited, the
  overlay gets removed but the text remains.
* `company-eclim` shows method overloads and expands templates for calls.
* `company-clang-objc-templatify` does not insert spaces after colons anymore.
* `company-clang` is now only initialized in supported buffers.
  So, no error messages if you don't have Clang until you open a C file.

* New commands `company-select-previous-or-abort` and
  `company-select-next-or-abort`, bound to `<up>` and `<down>`.

## 2013-03-19 (0.6)

* Across-the-board bugfixing.
* `company-pysmell` is not used by default anymore.
* Loading of `nxml`, `semantic`, `pymacs` and `ropemacs` is now deferred.
* Candidates from grouped back-ends are merged more conservatively: only
  back-ends that return the same prefix at point are used.
* `company-clang` now shows meta information, too.
* Some performance improvements.
* Fixed two old tooltip annoyances.
* Instead of `overrriding-terminal-local-map`, we're now using
  `emulation-mode-map-alists` (experimental).  This largely means that when the
  completion keymap is active, other minor modes' keymaps are still used, so,
  for example, it's not as easy to accidentally circumvent `paredit-mode`
  when it's enabled.
* `company-elisp` has seen some improvements.
* Added `company-capf`: completion adapter using
  `completion-at-point-functions`.  (Stefan Monnier)
* Clang completions now include macros and are case-sensitive.
